# How to Use

## Learn from test cases

[BlockchainApplicationTests](https://github.com/pravsingh/Blockchain/blob/master/src/test/java/com/hashfold/blockchain/app/BlockchainApplicationTests.java) class has tests cases which will execute the flow and validate the results.

## Start Server and interact with Swagger

run ./start.sh which will build the code and start the server at 8080 port.

Swagger is available at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
